# SP24-Gaze-Controlled-Keyboard-Inspired-By-SSVEP-Methods

Brian Tan, Septia Rani

## Project Description
In this project, we aim to create a simple gaze-controlled keyboard that will be accessible to the public. The method is inspired by the Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP). However, it should be noted that the system that we create is not a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).
